# Pong Game
The Pong Game is a classic arcade game implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles controlled by the players, and a ball that bounces between the paddles. The goal is to prevent the ball from hitting the edges of the screen while trying to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay: The game supports two players, each controlling a paddle on opposite sides of the screen. Players can compete against each other to score points by hitting the ball past their opponent's paddle.
- Paddles controlled by the players using keyboard inputs: Each player can control their paddle using keyboard inputs. Player 1 can use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to move their paddle up and down, while Player 2 can use the "W" and "S" keys to control their paddle.
- Ball movement and bouncing: The ball moves continuously across the screen and bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom edges of the screen. The direction of the ball changes when it collides with a paddle, allowing players to strategically hit the ball and outmaneuver their opponent.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the players' scores, displaying them on the screen. Whenever a player successfully hits the ball past their opponent's paddle, their score is incremented.
- Game over and restart: The game continues until a certain score limit is reached or until players choose to exit the game. When the game ends, players have the option to restart and play again.

## How to Play
1. Run the game: Launch the Python script to start the game.
2. Player controls: Each player controls their respective paddle using the assigned keyboard inputs. Player 1 moves their paddle up and down using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys, while Player 2 controls their paddle with the "W" and "S" keys.
3. Gameplay: The ball will start moving across the screen, and players need to hit the ball with their paddles to prevent it from reaching the edges of the screen. The ball will bounce off the paddles and change direction accordingly.
4. Scoring: Whenever a player successfully hits the ball past their opponent's paddle, their score will be incremented. The score will be displayed on the screen for both players to see.
5. Game over: The game continues until a certain score limit is reached or until players choose to exit the game. At the end of the game, players have the option to restart and play again.
